* Advent of Code 2024
Another fun year of [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]]!

Chose Rust this year again. Also working at a much more leisurely
pace this year instead of trying to stay up to date.

Run a day with example
#+begin_src bash
cargo run --release --example day3
#+end_src

Or with actual input (saved in data/ folder)
#+begin_src bash
cargo run --release --example day3 -- -f data/day3
#+end_src
